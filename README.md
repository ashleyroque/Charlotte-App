### **Charlotte App – Event Discovery Prototype**  
**Project Status**: Prototype (Figma) | **Tech Stack**: UX/UI Design  
**Repo**: [Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/1EBSEC41v5ta2Pf2UpdE1s/Charlotte-App--Final-Project-for-ITIS-3130?node-id=18-148&p=f&t=jLuglJw8WeDzY2sM-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=18%3A148)  

#### **Problem Statement**  
Charlotte lacks a centralized platform for discovering local events (concerts, markets, etc.), forcing residents to rely on scattered social media posts that lack reminders and organization.  

#### **Solution**  
A mobile app that:  
- **Curates personalized event recommendations** in ≤5 taps.  
- **Integrates ticket purchases** and notifications.  
- **Allows event organizers to post listings** with details (date, location, category).  

#### **Key Features**  
✅ **User Flow**: Login → Location-based event feed → Ticket purchase (mock transaction).  
✅ **Organizer Tools**: Form to post events with thumbnails, categories, and descriptions.  
✅ **UX Highlights**:  
  - Toggle for event reminders.  
  - Saved payment methods (radio buttons).  
  - Tab-based navigation (Home, Tickets, Notifications).  

#### **Design Process**  
1. **Needfinding**: Interviewed a UNCC student (primary user) validating pain points with social media-based event discovery.  
2. **Prototyping**: Built in Figma under 48 hours (solo project due to team constraints).  
3. **Usability Test**: Positive feedback on intuitiveness and aesthetic.  

#### **Future Improvements**  
- Edit posted events.  
- Social media integrations (Instagram/FB sharing).  
- Expanded payment gateways.
